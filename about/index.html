	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> Hi!! I'm Ying Xiong. You can call me Jessica. My pronoun is she/her. Nice to meet you all!</p>
	<p>I'm a 4th-year student at the University of Toronto with a Specialist in Finance & Economics and a Major in Statistics. Right now, 
		I'm living in China and taking online lectures due to the COVID. Hope we can get back to the in-person setting soon! </p>
	<p>In my spare time, I enjoy watching Japanese anime and movies with my friends. I also spend a lot of time doing puzzles, sudoku, and LEGO. 
		Among all kinds of games, I like the puzzle games best as I need to collect information in various ways and combine them to make progress. 
		The sense of accomplishment satisfies me a lot. Additionally, I like taking walks around the city and explore different scenes. 
		When it comes to vacations, I usually travel with my family or friends and explore delicacies in various places.</p>

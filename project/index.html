     <h4>Project Coordinator - Funny World (2018.3 - 2018.7) </h4>
  <p> As an intern, I engaged and gained experience in various departments. In the finance department, I analyzed project costs and forecasted profits 
        based on market trends and the performance of similar products. Liaising with software and hardware engineers, I helped wrote product manuals, 
        tested prototype equipment, and identified deficiencies. During the tenure, I designed and finished a proposal of a prototype for a silk weaving 
        AR educational program. <br />

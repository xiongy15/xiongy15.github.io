  <h4>Project Intern (ALM) - Pramerica FOSUN (2021.7 - 2021.9) </h4>
  <p> I worked as an Project Inter in the Pramerica FOSUN from 2021.7 to 2021.9. As an intern, practiced financial modeling 
      with interest risk and reporting in aspects of solvency risks. I assisted in promoting the construction of an ALM model 
      using the key rate duration (DV01) and the par bond defeasance, enhancing model designs on the asset market value calculation 
      in Excel after liaising with the parent company Pramerica, and helped prepare ALM reports featuring data visualization. From 
      this practical experience, I deepened my understanding of the ALM system and learned advanced liability analysis methods such 
      as interest risk management models in the industry. While making recommendations on adjusting interest rate risk management 
      objectives to solve problems in line with CBRC-proposed measures, I learned that companies can be subject to unique conditions 
      that require customized risk management to attain optimal strategic planning. <br />

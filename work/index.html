	<h1>Work Experience</h1>
  
  <h4>Mentor - University of Toronto Statistics Department (2020 - Present) </h4>
  <br />
  <p> I joined the mentorship program in my third year. As a mentor, I provided instructions on career exploration and social & personal development 
        in one-to-one settings to the first-year students. I was obligated to conduct meetings with them and help them solve problems related to academics 
        and social life. After appointments, I connected mentees with various resources including study groups, academic advisors, clubs and the wellness 
        center. I designed and held two sizeable online career events via Zoom during the tenure and received positive responses. <br />
    - Appointments on career exploration and social & personal development <br />
    - Connect with resources <br />
    - Design and hold large online social/career events <br /> </p>
    
  <h4>Project Coordinator - Funny World (2018.3 - 2018.7) </h4>
  <br />
  <p> As an intern, I engaged and gained experience in various departments. In the finance department, I analyzed project costs and forecasted profits 
        based on market trends and the performance of similar products. Liaising with software and hardware engineers, I helped wrote product manuals, 
        tested prototype equipment, and identified deficiencies. During the tenure, I designed and finished a proposal of a prototype for a silk weaving 
        AR educational program. <br />

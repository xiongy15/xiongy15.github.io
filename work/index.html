  <h4>Statistics Intern - Shanghai Banking Bureau (2021.5 - Present) </h4>
  <p> I worked in the Statistics department in the Shanghai Banking Bureau since the start of the 2021 summer. As an intern, I organized the 2020 
	  monthly/quarterly/annual reports on the Banking and Insurance Industry in the first week. I learned a lot of in-depth knowledge by 
	  summarizing the analysis. Meanwhile, I helped the team produce the latest monthly/quarterly reports by collecting and updating data for 
	  further modeling and analysis. I'm also in charge of conducting negotiations with the other departments for feedback on changes in the 
	  reporting measures. <br />

  <h4>Mentor - University of Toronto Statistics Department (2020.9 - 2021.4) </h4>
  <p> I joined the mentorship program in my third year. As a mentor, I provided instructions on career exploration and social & personal development 
        in one-to-one settings to the first-year students. I was obligated to conduct meetings with them and help them solve problems related to academics 
        and social life. After appointments, I connected mentees with various resources including study groups, academic advisors, clubs and the wellness 
        center. I designed and held two sizeable online career events via Zoom during the tenure and received positive responses. <br />

  <h4>Project Coordinator - Funny World (2018.3 - 2018.7) </h4>
  <p> As an intern, I engaged and gained experience in various departments. In the finance department, I analyzed project costs and forecasted profits 
        based on market trends and the performance of similar products. Liaising with software and hardware engineers, I helped wrote product manuals, 
        tested prototype equipment, and identified deficiencies. During the tenure, I designed and finished a proposal of a prototype for a silk weaving 
        AR educational program. <br />

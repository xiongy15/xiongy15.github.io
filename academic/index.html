    Finance & Economics, and I choose to take Statistics as a major due to my personal interest. My current GPA is 3.95 out of 4. I have been on the Dean’s List for 
    2018-2019 & 2019-2020 academic year.</p>

  <p> I have a solid academic background in finance. I excelled in my coursework and consistently scored among the top 5% of all students. 
  To further strengthen my quantitative abilities, I took multiple courses on mathematics and statistical science. 
  I am committed to developing my technical skills. At present, I am proficient in RStudio, SQL, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. 
  I also hold SAS Base and Advanced certificates. My background has equipped me with the skills necessary to analyze large volumes of data. 
  Thus, I am confident in my ability to execute research and modeling projects. </p>
  
  <p> I developed solid financial research and valuation skills. For example, I participated in the Wharton China Business Society Case Competition 
    as a group leader and valuated assets of LeEco. I ran simulations under multiple scenarios and identified promising assets for investors. 
    I also developed risk management strategies and was awarded 2nd Place for my oral and written submissions. In addition, I have attended the China Youth 
    Business League Case Competition and won 3rd Place for the business plan. I analyzed Dunkin Donuts China business strategy and outlined recommendations 
    for the company’s expansion. To extend, I developed a product differentiation plan based on the review of competitors and local preferences and identified
    new business opportunities for the company with risk management strategies. </p>
  
  <p> During my university academic life, I kept offering freelance tutoring on Calculus and Economics in one-to-one and group settings and maintained exceptional student evaluations. 
    I developed individualized study plans and helped all students to achieve their educational goals. I believe it will also contribute to my knowledge consolidation on these subjects, 
    preparing me for more in-depth courses.</p>
	
  <p> I'm currently working as a research assistant for Prof. Lu at the Tongji University on spatial correlation effects in the negative externality of U.S dollars. The research helped 
    me consolidate knowledge on spatial econometric and also model building and analyzing skills. </p>
